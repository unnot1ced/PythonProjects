# Small Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of small Python projects!

I'm working on a variety of Python projects to explore different programming concepts and improve my skills. Each project is a small step forward in my learning journey, helping me get a deeper understanding of Python along the way.

## Projects

- **Project 1**: A console-based alarm clock created with Pygame.
- **Project 2**: A sleek digital clock built using PyQt5.
- **More projects coming soonâ€¦**

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or provide feedback. I am always open to suggestions and would love to hear ideas for new projects!

## Notes

Some projects require external libraries, and these will be clearly mentioned at the top of each respective file.

Stay tuned for updates and new projects in the near future!
